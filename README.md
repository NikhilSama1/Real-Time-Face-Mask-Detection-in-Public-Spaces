# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-in-Public-Spaces
This project proposes a real-time crowd density estimation system for public safety, utilizing a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to generate density maps from live camera feeds in public spaces like stadiums or transit hubs. The goal is to monitor crowd levels instantly, enabling proactive safety measures during events or emergencies.
