# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-in-Public-Spaces
This project aims to develop a real-time face mask detection system for public spaces using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify whether individuals are wearing masks correctly, addressing public health compliance amid pandemics. The system targets rapid identification in video feeds from surveillance cameras, enhancing safety in crowded areas like airports or malls. It builds on prior work, such as Loey et al. (2021) [Ref: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110600], which used ResNet-50 for mask detection, and leverages the open-source YOLOv5 framework (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for its efficiency in object detection. I will extend YOLOv5 by fine-tuning it for binary classification (mask/no-mask) and optimizing it for edge deployment, reducing latency on devices like the NVIDIA Jetson. The project will utilize the Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection), containing annotated images of people with and without masks.
